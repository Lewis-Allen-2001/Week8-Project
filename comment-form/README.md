For this project, I developed a comment form that allows users to submit feedback on posts. My main goal was to create a smooth user experience, with comments being stored in the database and retrieved correctly for display. Iâ€™m happy to report that I achieved the primary requirements of this feature, including user input validation, form submission, and the storage of comments in the database.

However, the project didnâ€™t come without its challenges. One major issue took me an entire weekend to resolve. The problem was with my database queries (db.queries), which were incorrectly structured. This led to data handling issues, where form submissions either failed entirely or produced inaccurate results in the database. It took considerable time and debugging to identify the specific errors and correct the queries so that the data flow between the frontend and backend was functioning properly. Once resolved, the form worked as intended, and I was able to ensure that all user-submitted comments were stored and retrieved efficiently.

ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?
I was able to implement the core functionality of the comment form, including user validation, form submission, and the proper storage of user comments in the database. I also ensured that comments could be retrieved and displayed correctly in the user interface, meeting the projectâ€™s basic requirements.

ðŸŽ¯ What was difficult about these tasks?
The main difficulty I encountered was the issue with my db.queries. The way I was structuring my database calls caused data handling problems, and it took extensive troubleshooting to find the errors. Additionally, integrating real-time updates into the comment section was more complex than expected, particularly in ensuring smooth and consistent communication between the client and server without overloading resources. Despite these challenges, the project taught me valuable lessons about the importance of well-structured database queries and the intricacies of backend-to-frontend data flow.
